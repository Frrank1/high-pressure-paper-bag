A High Pressure Paper Bag
=========================

A durable gas bag is an important part of every software project.
If only to give you a place to scream when nothing works.

This is an experimental library to perform quick and dirty air pressure
calculations for interactive space-station like game environments.
Regions where gas can move are heuristically partitioned into rough regions
where air exchange is considered instantaneous.

### Building

The project is written in **c++** and built with **cmake**. Someday there is
the intention to add bindings to higher level languages, but none currently
exist.

Any tests in the `tests` directory will require the **googletest** library.

### Licence

This project is licenced under the Mozilla Public License 2.
